NEAT V3  

The third iteration of an evolution architecture made as a learning project.
This version should be more efficient due to fixing overuse of some classes.


TODO:
- Maybe make test cases for the libraries to make sure I don't break anything indev  
- Finish mutations 
- Finish breeding (refer to paper for this)
